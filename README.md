# Quiltr

## Dependencies

Install build dependencies with `npm install`. Install runtime dependencies with
`bower install`.

-   [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
-   [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
-   [fabric.js](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js)

## Structure

Build dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json). Client
dependencies are stored in [`bower.json`](bower.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.
